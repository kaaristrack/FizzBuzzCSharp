# FizzBuzz C#!

### Synopsis

Welcome to my "FizzBuzz" tech-test challenge repo! Fizzbuzz is a typical interview task that is designed to filter out 99.9% of programmers who do not (yet) have the technical ability to translate theoretical skills into functional code. The general premise of FizzBuzz is as follows:

*"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."*

### Key Focus
Test-Driven Development (TDD).

### Stack
- C#.

### Implementation
1) Clone this repository, and change into the correct directory.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kaaristrack/FizzBuzzCSharp
$ cd FizzBuzzCSharp
```
2) Compile and run using Visual Studio Community!
